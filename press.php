			<h1>Eko Raises $1 Million Seed Funding from 500 Startups, Siemer Ventures, and Top Asia-Pacific Business Leaders</h1>

			<p>BANGKOK, THAILAND, April 9th 2014 - Eko Communications today announced it has completed a $1 million round of seed financing. Institutional investors include global venture capital firm 500 Startups and Siemer Ventures, and angel investors include the CEO of one of Southeast Asia's leading telecom conglomerates, the chairman of one of China's largest health products companies, among several others.</p>

			<p>Eko is a Bangkok and New York based company creating mobile-oriented workplace communications solutions for large enterprises. Eko allows companies to streamline communications, productivity, and workflow. Since its limited launch last September, Eko has been officially deployed and adopted by companies representing a total of $3.3 billion in revenue, and has confirmed deployment plans to companies representing over $20 billion in total revenue.</p>

			<p>Commenting on Eko, Chartsiri Sophonpanich, President of Bangkok Bank, said, "As smartphone use in the workplace peaks, business leaders have an unprecedented opportunity to transform the way they communicate and collaborate with their colleagues."</p>

			<p>"Modern enterprises are already mobile savvy, using consumer apps like Whatsapp or WeChat to communicate with colleagues. However, these apps are not designed to meet enterprise needs, Eko is" said Khailee Ng, Venture Partner at 500 Startups.</p>

			<p>Eko's unique solution is to it cater to the specific needs of all levels of employees, be they management, office, or front line staff. The idea, born out of the founder's high school dorm room, graduated from the TigerLabs Accelerator in Princeton, New Jersey as a finished product, yet since that time it has been continually improved and updated, expanding from New York to Bangkok to cater to enterprise demand from Asia.</p>

			<p>"People have been touting mobile as 'the future' for a while now. It's already here. It's here to stay. What will mobile do to transform workplaces? This is our mission. And this is a good start." said Korawad Chearavanont, Founder of Eko.</p>
