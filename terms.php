		<h2>8. Third Party Content and Interactions</h2>

		<p>The Site and Services may contain features and functionalities that may link you or provide you with access to third party content which is completely independent of Eko, including Web sites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet as a whole.  Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Site and Services are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides:  A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.</p>

		<h2>9. Links</h2>

		<p>Our Site and Services may contain links to other Web sites, or allow others to send you such links.  A link to a third party's Web site does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it.  We are not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to the use of any third-party Web site.  You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party Web site before using it.</p>

		<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages.  Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you.

		<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

		<p>The failure of Eko to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent Eko from enforcing such right or provision in the future.</p>

		<p>We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, a sale of assets or by operation of law.</p>
